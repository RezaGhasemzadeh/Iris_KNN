Hello, this is my first project in machine learning and I'm very excited to share it with you! I used Iris dataset and splitted it  into two parts, train and test, then I used
KNN algorithm(A Classification algorithm in supervised learning) to predict that which iris flower category does each sample of the test data blongs to.

### The Tools that I used in this project are:
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Python programming language
